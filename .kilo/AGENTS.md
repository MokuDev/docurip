Behavioral rules to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Apply to every code write, review, and refactor.

## 1. Think Before Coding

- State assumptions explicitly before implementing. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No speculative "flexibility" or "configurability".
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite to 50.

Test: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Test: every changed line must trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass
- "Fix the bug" → write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass
- "Refactor X" → ensure tests pass before and after

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan with verification per step:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria enable independent looping. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification — avoid them.

## Kilo Code Integration

Kilo Code loads skills from `.kilo/skills/`, agents from `.kilo/agents/`, and slash commands from `.kilo/command/`. All three are included in this repository.

### Core Rules

- If a task matches a skill, you MUST invoke it
- Skills are located in `.kilo/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- Never implement directly if a skill applies
- Always follow the skill instructions exactly (do not partially apply them)

### Intent → Skill Mapping

The agent should automatically map user intent to skills:

- Feature / new functionality → `spec-driven-development`, then `incremental-implementation`, `test-driven-development`
- Planning / breakdown → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- Bug / failure / unexpected behavior → `debugging-and-error-recovery`
- Code review → `code-review-and-quality`
- Refactoring / simplification → `code-simplification`
- API or interface design → `api-and-interface-design`
- UI work → `frontend-ui-engineering`

### Lifecycle Mapping

Slash commands in `.kilo/command/` map to development phases:

- `/spec` → `spec-driven-development`
- `/plan` → `planning-and-task-breakdown`
- `/build` → `incremental-implementation` + `test-driven-development`
- `/test` → `test-driven-development`
- `/review` → `code-review-and-quality`
- `/code-simplify` → `code-simplification`
- `/webperf` → `web-performance-auditor` agent (single-persona web performance audit)
- `/ship` → `shipping-and-launch` (parallel fan-out via `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, `test-engineer`)

### Anti-Rationalization

The following thoughts are incorrect and must be ignored:

- "This is too small for a skill"
- "I can just quickly implement this"
- "I'll gather context first"

Correct behavior: always check for and use skills first.

## Orchestration: Personas, Skills, and Commands

This repo has three composable layers. They have different jobs and should not be confused:

- **Skills** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — workflows with steps and exit criteria. The *how*. Mandatory hops when an intent matches.
- **Personas** (`agents/<role>.md`) — roles with a perspective and an output format. The *who*.
- **Slash commands** (`.claude/commands/*.md` for Claude Code, `.kilo/command/*.md` for Kilo Code) — user-facing entry points. The *when*. The orchestration layer.

Composition rule: **the user (or a slash command) is the orchestrator. Personas do not invoke other personas.** A persona may invoke skills.

The only multi-persona orchestration pattern this repo endorses is **parallel fan-out with a merge step** — used by `/ship` to run `code-reviewer`, `security-auditor`, and `test-engineer` concurrently and synthesize their reports. Do not build a "router" persona that decides which other persona to call; that's the job of slash commands and intent mapping.

See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for the decision matrix and [references/orchestration-patterns.md](references/orchestration-patterns.md) for the full pattern catalog.
